# rojoma-json

## Getting it

Starting with version 2.0.0, rojoma-json is published on Maven
central, so setting up SBT is as simple as

```scala
libraryDependencies += "com.rojoma" %% "rojoma-json" % "%VERSION%" cross CrossVersion.Full
```

The `CrossVersion.Full` is required because rojoma-json uses [Macro
Paradise](http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/macros/paradise.html),
which is specific to minor Scala versions.

While for Maven, the pom snippet is:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.rojoma</groupId>
    <artifactId>rojoma-json_${scala.version}</artifactId>
    <version>%VERSION%</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

rojoma-json is published for Scala version 2.10.{2,3,4}.  Versions
2.0.0 and 2.1.0 are also published for all previous released Scala
versions since 2.8.1.

## Documentation

### package com.rojoma.json.ast

 * `JValue`: An AST for JSON
    * `JAtom`
       * `JNull`
       * `JBoolean(boolean: Boolean)`
       * `JString(string: String)`
       * `JNumber(bigdecimal: BigDecimal)`
    * `JCompound`
       * `JArray(toSeq: scala.collection.Seq[JValue])`
       * `JObject(fields: scala.collection.Map[String, JValue])`

The `JCompound` classes extend `Iterable` and have convenience methods
that make them act like `Seq` and `Map` respectively, but are not
themselves actually `Seq`s or `Map`s.  Use the `toSeq`, or `fields` or
`toMap`, method to get a real one.

All `JValue`s have a `cast[T]` method that can be used to safely
downcast to a more specific type.

### package com.rojoma.json.codec

 * `JsonCodec[T]`: a typeclass for converting objects to/from JSON
    * `encode(x: T): JValue`
    * `decode(x: JValue): Option[T]`

The following types have implicit codecs in `JsonCodec`'s compantion:

 * `String`
 * `Boolean`
 * Numeric types, including `BigInt`, `BigDecimal`, and their `java.math` counterparts
 * `JValue` and all its subclasses
 * Any `S[T] <: Seq[T]` if `T` has a `JsonCodec` and `S` has an implicit `CanBuild`
 * Any `M[String, T] <: Map[String, T]` if `T` has a `JsonCodec` and `M` has an implicit `CanBuild`
 * `java.util.List[T]` if `T` has a `JsonCodec`
 * `java.util.Map[String, T]` if `T` has a `JsonCodec`

Numeric codecs are "lenient" -- that is, if a number is out of range
of the requested type, it undergoes the normal truncation
`BigDecimal.toXXX` does.  If this is not desired, request a
`BigDecimal` or a `JValue` and use the `.toXXXExact` alternatives.

`JsonCodec` itself can be used as a value that represents the result
of an implicit search for a codec.  That is:

```scala
JsonCodec[T] === implicitly[JsonCodec[T]]
```

### package com.rojoma.json.io

 * `JsonReader`: Convert character data to `JValues`
 * `JsonWriter`: Convert `JValues` to character data
    * `CompactJsonWriter`
    * `PrettyJsonWriter`

The two concrete `JsonWriter` classes have `toWriter` and `toString`
convenience methods on their companion objects.  `JsonReader`,
similarly, has `fromString` and `fromWriter`.  Neither `JsonReader`
nor the `JsonWriter`s make any effort to minimize the number of calls
to `read()` or `write()` on the IO handle they're given, so it is
probably a good idea to ensure that it is buffered.

As extensions to the JSON specification, `JsonReader` accepts the
following:

 * single-quote delimited strings
 * unquoted object keys
 * Javascript-style comments

The only limits on the sizes of strings and depth of nesting are those
of the JVM.  Parsing is done recursively, and so stack space is the
limiting factor in nesting.  Numbers are restricted to those which can
fit in a Java `BigDecimal`.  The reader does validate surrogate pairs
and will replace stray halves with the Unicode `REPLACEMENT_CHARACTER`
character.  `JsonReader` also guarantees to read exactly as much as
necessary as to read a single `JValue` -- i.e., only to the closing
delimiter for objects, arrays, and strings, and one character past for
all other types of JSON datum.

There is also semi-experimental support for operating on JSON input as
token or event streams.  `TokenIterator` is an iterator class which
takes a `Reader` and produces positioned `JsonToken` objects, or a
`JsonLexException` if the input contains invalid tokens.
`JsonEventIterator` takes the output of `TokenIterator` and produces
positioned `JsonEvent`s.  `JsonEventIterator` will only produce events
for syntatically valid JSON input; if the input is malformed, some
subclass of `JsonParseException` is thrown.

`JsonReader` is implemented in terms of the two iterator classes and
so they share the same minimal-read contract that is has.

### package com.rojoma.json.matcher

 * `OptPattern`: The base class of all `Pattern`s, plus `POption`
    * `Pattern`: A specification for extracting data from `JValue`s
       * `Literal(x: JValue)`: match a literal value
       * `FLiteral(f: JValue => Boolean)`: conditionally match a value
       * `PArray(subpatterns: Pattern*)`: match an array containing values that match a series of patterns
       * `PObject(subpatterns: (String, OptPattern)*)`: match an object containing fields that match patterns
       * `FirstOf(subpatterns: Pattern*)`: try to match a series of patterns in turn
       * `AllOf(subpatterns: OptPattern*)`: match a series of patterns in turn
       * `Variable[T : JsonCodec]`: match a value of type `T`
    * `POption(subpattern: Pattern)`: Optionally match a pattern.  Only valid in a `PObject` and `AllOf`.

These are probably best understood with a simple example:

```scala
val channel = Variable[String]() // Could be anything with a JsonCodec instance
val text = Variable[String]()
val ChatPattern =
  PObject("command" -> "chat",
          "to" -> channel,
          "message" -> text)
val JoinPattern =
  PObject("command" -> "join",
          "channel" -> channel)
val LeavePattern =
  PObject("command" -> "leave",
          "channel" -> channel,
          "message" -> POption(text))

def process(message: JValue) = message match {
  case ChatPattern(results) =>
    sendText(channel(results), text(results))
  case JoinPattern(results) =>
    joinChannel(channel(results))
  case LeavePattern(results) =>
    departChannel(channel(results), text.get(results))
  case _ =>
    error("unknown command", message)
}

def leaveChannel(channelName: String, message: Option[String]): JValue =
  LeavePattern.generate(channel := channelName, text :=? message)
```

`OptPattern`'s companion contains implicit conversions from various
literal forms into `Pattern`s.

Information is extracted by means of `Variable` patterns.  `Variable`s
can be created with the `apply` method on the companion object.  They
are typed and will only succeed in matching if the value at their
position is of the correct type.  If a single `Variable` appears more
than once in a `Pattern`, it is not an error, but all appearances must
match the same value.

Any object with an implicit `JsonCodec` instance in scope can be
automatically coerced to a literal `Pattern`.

The result of a match is an opaque object which can be given to a
`Variable` to extract the data, either by applying the `Variable` like
a function or calling its `get` method.  `Variables` and `Pattern`s
themselves are immutable.

`PObject` will accepts multiple patterns for a single field; all must
accept for the containing `PObject` to accept.  If the target of a
field is marked optional by wrapping it in a `POption`, it either must
match the subpattern or not appear at all.  To tolerate random
unparsable data in a field, use FirstOf with a final branch that
accepts anything.

In `AllOf`, if a field is marked with POption, the value under
consideration is allowed to _not_ match that particular subpattern.
In this context, `POption(p)` is a shorthand for `FirstOf(p, Variable[JValue]())`.

Custom matchers can be defined by subclassing `Pattern` and
implementing the method `evaluate(x: JValue, environment: Pattern.Results): Option[Pattern.Results]`.

Most `Pattern`s can also be used to generate JSON using the `generate`
method, passing in a list of variable bindings in the form `variable := value` or,
if the variable occurs in an "optional" position (i.e., inside a `POption`
or `FirstOf`) `variable :=? optValue`, where `optValue` is an `Option`.

### package com.rojoma.json.zipper

A zipper for navigating JSON.  There are five interfaces:

 * `JsonZipper`
    * `JAtomZipper`
    * `JArrayZipper`
    * `JObjectZipper`
 * `NothingZipper`

An array or object zipper may be acquired by calling `asArray` or
`asObject` on a generic zipper.

Each of the first five allows you to move `up`, to the `top` of the
object, or find the zipper's current `value`, `replace`, or `remove`
it.  In addition, the array and object zippers allow `replace`ing or
`remove`ing child elements.  All of the motion operators (except
`top`) return `Option`s; suffix the operator with `_!` to make it
return the value directly or throw a `NoSuchElementException` if the
motion is impossible.

The `NothingZipper` is special -- it is what is returned from removing
the current object.  With a `NothingZipper` you can either put a new
object in the hole it represents (via the `replace` method) or move
`up` or to the `top`.  Unlike the `JsonZipper` classes, when you have
nothing `top` might not return anything, since it is possible that the
root object is what was removed.

### package com.rojoma.json.jpath

The `JPath` class is a simple wrapper over `JsonZipper`s for doing
"xpath-style" queries on a `JValue`.  This is currently somewhat
experimental, but is so far promising.

```scala
// Find the first name of all users that live in Tucson
new JPath(myObject).down("users").*.having(_.down("city").where(_.here == JString("Tucson"))).down("firstName").finish
```

The result is a `Stream[JValue]`.  Currently `JPath` is a read-only
interface.

### package com.rojoma.json.util

Utility operations that combine parts from other packages.  The main
member of this package is the object `JsonUtil` which contains
convenience methods for moving data all the way between character data
and usable objects. 

However, despite my distrust of all things reflective, this package
also contains an object called `SimpleJsonCodecBuilder`, which uses a
tiny amount of reflection to make producing `JsonCodec`s for case
classes easier.  It's very straightforward to use:

```scala
case class Foo(a: Int, b: Option[String])
object Foo {
  implicit val jCodec = SimpleJsonCodecBuilder[Foo].build("a", _.a, "b", _.b)
}
```

This can be used to build codecs for any classes which have accessors
that match up to their constructor parameters.  The names and
accessors must be provided in the same order the constructor takes
them, or you will either get an exception when `build` is called
(because it can't find the right constructor) or you'll get a
`JsonCodec` that doesn't roundtrip properly (if the types of the
accessors just happen to line up with the types of the constructor
parameters).  The types of the values to be serialized must either
have `JsonCodec`s themselves, or be `Option`s wrapping around such
types.  `build` comes in variants that will handle up to 22 fields.

Beginning with version 2.2.0, rojoma-json also contains a macro-based
`AutomaticJsonCodecBuilder`.  Due to the experimental nature of macros
themselves, this is also a somewhat experimental feature.  It allows
fully automatic generation of `JsonCodec`s for classes which have
accessors that match the names and types of all non-implicit
parameters of the primary constructor.  The above example using this
system would be simply:

```scala
case class Foo(a: Int, b: Option[String])
object Foo {
  implicit val jCodec = AutomaticJsonCodecBuilder[Foo]
}
```

The generation can be affected by placing annotations (also defined in
the `util` package) on the subject class's constructor's parameters.
The annotations are:

* `@JsonKey("string literal")` which overrides automatic selection of
  the field's name in the generated JSON.
* `@NullForNone` which causes the field to generate a `null` if it is
  an empty `Option`.  Ordinarily empty `Option`s are simply omitted
  from generation altogether.
* `@LazyCodec` which causes the codec for the field to be resolved
  lazily.  It is ordinarily not necessary, but can be used to stop
  stack overflows or `NullPointerException`s building codecs for
  recursive data structures.
* `@JsonKeyStrategy(strategy)` to override the subject class's default
  key generation strategy.

The two defined strategies are `Strategy.Identity` (the default) and
`Strategy.Underscore` (which converts camel-case names to lower-case,
underscore-separated names).  The `@JsonKeyStrategy` annotation can
also be used on the class level to set the default strategy for all
fields.  If two names map to the same JSON identifier (whether
automatically or through use of `@JsonKey`) a compiler error occurs.

## Future paths

I'm looking forward to [string
interpolation](future/StringInterpolation.scala).
In addition, there are [other planned improvements](future/future.txt)
which would break binary compatibility, for version 3.0.

## Incompatible changes from rojoma-json 1

In the low-level IO code, the various `Positioned` classes are gone.
Instead all tokens and events carry their own positions.  As a
consequence, none of the tokens or events are singleton objects anymore.
Instead, they're case classes with empty parameter lists.
`TokenIterator` is renamed to `JsonTokenIterator` (since it always
returned `JsonToken`s anyway).  None of the `JsonReaderException`s
are case classes any longer.

`JsonZipper` has lost its useless and annoying type parameter in
addition to other minor changes to the API to make it generally more
pleasant to use.

In the utilities package, the builders have had their `gen` method
renamed to `build`.
