Directional Path
  - abstract base class with methods toList and toListReversed
  - two subclasses, one of which builds headwards and one of which builds tailwards
     - when an opposite builder is chosen, switch subclass

NO EXCEPTIONS
  - except (heh) when implementing an API that doesn't allow Either (i.e., iterators)

Automatic JsonEncoders should return JObject, not JValue

A way to encode straight to a Writer without having a JValue intermediate

Allow interning string (and number?) values on read

kill FieldCodec (split the scala enum codec into a FieldEncode and a
FieldDecode like everything else)
  -- maybe.  I forget you need to provide the enum to the codec non-explicitly

Make JsonUtil encoders take a `trailingNewline` boolean (default true)
