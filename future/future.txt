For the next break in binary compatibility (3.0):
  * Specialize JObject/JArray for small objects and arrays (if this
    can be done without breaking scalac's exhaustivity checking in
    pattern matching)
  * Make tokens and events take their positions in a secondary parameter
    list so that their Position fields can be immutable.
  * JsonCodec.apply[T] can probably be made a macro.  see:
